We compared a Birdirectional LSTM with 2 methods of fine-tuning BERT model for the tast of sentiment analysis.
For fine-tuning the BERT model, we used a NN and a logistic regression model. 
We trained and tested our model on a sentiment analysis dataset (SST2), which is a binary classification task.
The BERT model fine-tuned using a NN model led to the best result.
